# eBay Scraper
 
Idea for https://laptoppartpartpicker.tk/ website:
 * Enter search term of a laptop (a1398 2015 macbook pro), the website will then find you the average price of the machine on eBay and how long it will ussualy take to sell.
 * It will also find the average prices for all of the individual components (by appending terms like "display assembly" or "bottom casing" to the search), as well as how long it will ussualy take to sell all of those parts.
 * Everything is viewable in a Google Sheets document along with graphs and charts.
